In this lab work, users can easily draw a polyline on a map by clicking the "Line Drawing" button located on the top left corner of the map interface. After users have drawn their polyline, they can analyze it by clicking the "Simplify" button on the frontend. This feature provides a simplified version of the polyline, making it easier for users to visualize the path or area they have created. If users wish to remove the polyline from the map or draw a new one, simply click the "Remove" button. With the flexibility to modify the polyline as many times as they want, users can draw as many polylines as they wish and remove them at any time.

Please note that the "Simplify" button only simplifies the latest polyline that the user has drafted.
